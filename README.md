# pupil_habituation_23
This repository includes scripts used for stimuli presentation and pre-processing of eye-tracking, pupillometry data for an infant experiment testing habituation in sound-induced arousal.

Habituation to repeated sounds (6 repetitions) was tested in 5-month-old infants while watching to a video display of a toy car running. There were two conditions:
1) multi-sensory event: synchronous sound presentation to concurrent visual event (car hitting a wall) in the video.
2) uni-sensory event: asynchronous audio-visual presentation (sound presented suddenly while the car was running in circle).

The stimuli presentation script covers the entire experimental paradigm, made of Experiment 1 (pop-out task preceded by sound at increasing volume level; not included in the current project), and Experiment 2 (habituation task, included in this project).
